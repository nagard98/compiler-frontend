{Example used to test the parsing of selection statements}

program HelloSel;
var a : integer;

begin
   a := 100;
   
{ok if-else statement}   
   if( a < 20 ) then
      writeln("a is less than 20")
   else
      begin
         writeln("a is not less than 20");
      end;

{WRONG if statement. condition is not boolean}   
   if( a * 20 ) then
      writeln("a is less than 20")
end.
